# Pandas Sample Project – Bike Dataset Analysis

This is a beginner-level data analysis project built using pandas as part of my learning journey.  
The project focuses on analyzing and refining a dataset of used bikes to derive useful insights.

## Files Included

- Project1.py – Complete analysis script using pandas.
- BIKE DETAILS.csv – Raw dataset before preprocessing.
- BIKE DETAILS_CLEANED.csv – Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.
- README.md – Project documentation.

## Dataset

Source: Kaggle  
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/motorcycle-dataset/data

Description:  
The dataset contains information on used motorcycles including features like Name, Year, km_driven, Owner and Ex-showroom Price .

## Sample Insights

- Most common year of bikes: 2018–2021
- First-owner bikes are generally better maintained and less driven
- TVS Apache RTR 160 dominate the budget bike market under 75,000
- Ideal recommendation: 1st owner bikes with low kilometers and affordable price

## Tools Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- VS Code

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and clean tabular data using pandas
- Apply loc, iloc, describe, groupby, and sorting techniques
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis
- Export and save cleaned data for further use
